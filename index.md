### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Part 2 was one of my favorite to work on because I have always been a fan when it came to card games.
    Knowing how you can code essensentially anything you want is quite a unique feature that really only exist
    in coding. Being able to calculate Blackjack hands was quite fun and I was able to figure out how strings work
    and be able to use STOI for the face cards.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, Part 1 was another of my favorite because it was the great learning experience for me as i was able to
    understand a new concepts such as Try and Catch, and I also got a solid grip on vectors. I found it to be 
    something where i can gain valuable knowledge that I can use for my future projects. 

* Lab 4 
    Lab 4, Part 2 was a great learning experience for me as I created a game where the user tries to guess the secret
    number. I was happy to learn about if and else statements as they allowed me to add conditional logic to the game,
    making it more challenging and engaging. Overall, it was a fun and educational project.
